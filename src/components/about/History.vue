            Brief History
          </div>
          Before becoming Seventh-day Adventists, the founders of the
          denomination were sitting in the pews of other protestant churches in
          the early-to-mid 1800s. They were farmers, lawyers, teachers…and a
          handful of Adventism’s prominent early leaders were already involved
          in pastoral ministry.
          <br /><br />The roots of Adventism can be traced back to the Second
          Great Awakening, which inspired a spirit of revival throughout the
          United States in the late 1700s and early 1800s. More people had
          Bibles in their homes and began to study Scripture themselves rather
          than leaving that to clergy.<br /><br />Many biblical truths were
          brought back to light, such as the seventh-day Sabbath and the literal
          Second Coming of Christ. Tent meetings and Bible studies led people to
          a deeper understanding of God’s love and His plans for humanity.
          People began to crave a more authentic Christian walk, beyond the
          traditions and rituals that had been routine for so long.
          <br /><br />Several separate groups of these devout Christians were
          dispersed throughout the northeastern United States. But God brought
          them together, and what began as the “Advent Movement” is now a
          worldwide Christian protestant denomination with over 20 million
          members.
